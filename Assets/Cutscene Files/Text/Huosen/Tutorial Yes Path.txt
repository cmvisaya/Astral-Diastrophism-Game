You think for a moment to refresh your memory on combat...; @1<b>Tutorial</b>; What you see here is the Battle HUD. This provides all relevant information to you during hostile encounters.; On the top left are stats relevant to you and your allies. On the right, your enemies.; Each character has six items displayed: Their <b>level (Lvl), name, health points (HP), mana points (MP), Pips (P), and Daetra</b>; A character's <b>Daetra</b> is indicated by the color of their name.; Your goal is to defeat all enemies by reducing their HP down to 0; <b>The Pip System</b>; Pips determine how many actions a character can take on their turn.; Using any of the listed actions except for <b>END TURN</b> consume 1 Pip.; Each character has their own <b>Pip Regeneration Rate</b>, and Pips not consumed on a character's turn carry over to their next turn.; <b>Actions - END TURN</b>; <b>END TURN</b> passes actionability to the next alive character in your party. Passing with the last character in your party ends your parties turn, giving actionability to the enemy party.; Pass off your turn early to conserve Pips for later turns.; @8<b>Actions - RUN</b>; <b>RUN</b> allows you and your allies to attempt to prematurely escape an encounter.; Use this when your party is in a dire situation!; @4<b>Actions - ITEM</b>; <b>ITEM</b> allows you to draw an item from your inventory to be used in battle.; Use items to turn the tide of battle in your favor!; @7<b>Actions - GUARD</b>; <b>GUARD</b> halves the damage dealt to the guarding unit for the entirety of that round.; It is important to note that using <b>GUARD</b> also ends your turn.; @6<b>Actions - SKILL</b>; <b>SKILL</b> allows you to access that character's <b>skill slots</b>.; Each character has five skill slots at their disposal, though not all of them may contain a skill.; The first skill slot is always filled by that character's <b>BASIC ATTACK</b>, while the other four can be filled or swapped out as you gain more skills.; Skills also have a percentage chance to fizzle, in which case the skill is nullified but a Pip is still consumed.; <b>MANA</b>; Most skills have a <b>mana cost</b> specified by the number in parentheses. The <b>BASIC ATTACK</b> will always have a mana cost of 0.; @9Consuming mana equal to the mana cost of that skill allows you to use the skill.; @5<b>Half</b> of the damage a character takes when hit is replenished as mana. Characters who are <b>guarding</b> regenerate <b>all</b> damage taken as mana.; @6<b>Daetra - Effectivity/Resistance</b>; <b>Daetra</b> is the powerful physical manifestation of spirit and concept. Utilizing the effects of <b>The Daetra</b> can grant you a mighty advantage over your opponents.; There are six total <b>Daetra</b> which exist in pairs:
<b><color=#d2aa32>EXISTENCE</color> and <color=#282828>VOID</color> (COSMIC), <color=#187800>LIFE</color> and <color=#960096>DEATH</color> (MORTAL), <color=#000096>ORDER</color> and <color=#960000>CHAOS</color> (ENTROPIC)</b>; The pairings create a triangular flow of effectivity/resistance:
<b>COSMIC > MORTAL > ENTROPIC > COSMIC</b>; For example: Utilizing COSMIC (EXISTENCE or VOID) skills against a MORTAL (LIFE or DEATH) enemy grants a damage bonus to the attacker.; Conversly, utilizing COSMIC (EXISTENCE or VOID) skills against an ENTROPIC (ORDER or CHAOS) enemy reduces damage dealt to the enemy.; Additionally, within these pairs, one <b>Daetra</b> is positive, the other negative:
EXISTENCE [+], VOID [-], LIFE [+], DEATH [-], ORDER [+], CHAOS [-]; <b>CONTRARY</b> Daetra obtain a <b>damage bonus</b> against each other, while <b>PARALLEL</b> Daetra suffer from a <b>damage reduction</b> against each other.; Use these damage bonuses to your advantage against your opponents!; <b>Daetra - Daetra Swapping; All soul-possessing entities have the capacity for positivity and negativity, and can therefore swap between positive and negative Daetra at will, but must always remain confined within their conceptual pairing.; Each character has a <b>BASE DAETRA</b> which they will always begin encounters as. It is worth noting that every character's <b>BASIC ATTACK</b> has the same Daetra as that character's <b>BASE DAETRA</b>.; However, using a skill of any Daetra <b>CONTRARY</b> to that character's current Daetra will <b>swap that character's Daetra to it's contrary counterpart</b>.; @9For example:
A VOID (COSMIC <u>[-]</u>) character successfully using an ORDER (ENTROPIC <u>[+]</u>) skill swaps the skill user's Daetra to EXISTENCE (COSMIC <u>[+]</u>); Utilize Daetra Swapping to obtain the parallel damage reduction from enemy attacks!; @0Although it was a lot to take in, you remembered all you possibly could about combat.; `|1<b>Hotaru:</b> Well... I'll be sure to give it my all!;
